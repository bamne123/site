Return the indices (positions) of these two numbers.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\nInput: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`\\nOutput: `[0, 1]`\\nExplanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.\\n\\n## Time & Space Complexity\\n- **Time Complexity:** O(n)\\n- **Space Complexity:** O(n)\\n\\n## Solution\\n```python\\ndef twoSum(nums, target):\\n    num_map = {}\\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\\n        complement = target - num\\n        if complement in num_map:\\n            return [num_map[complement], i]\\n        num_map[num] = i\\n```\\n\\n## Solution Explanation\\nThe provided solution uses a hash map (`num_map`) to store each number encountered in the `nums` array along with its index. For each number, it calculates the `complement` needed to reach the `target`.  If the `complement` is found in the `num_map`, it means we have already seen the other number needed to reach the `target`, so we return the indices of both numbers. Otherwise, we add the current number and its index to the `num_map`.  This approach avoids nested loops, resulting in a linear time complexity.\\n\\n## LeetCode Official Solutions\\n- [Official LeetCode Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/solution/)\\n"\n}\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:'I have included the LeetCode problem URL in the title as a markdown link.
