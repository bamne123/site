Return the indices (positions) of these two numbers.\n\n**Example:**\n\nInput: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9`\nOutput: `[0, 1]`\nExplanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.\n\n## Time & Space Complexity\n- **Time Complexity:** O(n)\n- **Space Complexity:** O(n)\n\n## Solution\n```python\ndef twoSum(nums, target):\n    num_map = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in num_map:\n            return [num_map[complement], i]\n        num_map[num] = i\n```\n\n## Solution Explanation\nThe provided solution uses a hash map (`num_map`) to store each number encountered in the `nums` array along with its index. For each number, it calculates the `complement` needed to reach the `target`.  If the `complement` is found in the `num_map`, it means we have already seen the other number needed to reach the `target`, so we return the indices of both numbers. Otherwise, we add the current number and its index to the `num_map`.  This approach avoids nested loops, resulting in a linear time complexity.\n\n## LeetCode Official Solutions\n- [Official LeetCode Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/solution/)\n"

I have included the LeetCode problem URL in the title as a markdown link.  I've also provided a more detailed explanation of the problem and the provided solution.  The JSON structure now adheres to the specified format, with the markdown content stored in the "data" field.  The difficulty is set to "easy", the topic is set to "array", and the filename is "two-sum.md".  Since a solution was provided in the prompt (the Python code), I've included it, along with explanations of time and space complexity. I've added a link to the Official LeetCode solutions as well. This comprehensive approach makes the JSON output ready for direct use in generating LeetCode documentation.
