**Palindrome Number**

### Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `n`, return `true` if it is a palindrome number, and return `false` otherwise.

### Examples

* Input: 121
Output: `true`
Explanation: `121` is a palindrome number.
* Input: 123
Output: `false`
Explanation: `123` is not a palindrome number.
* Input: 12321
Output: `true`
Explanation: `12321` is a palindrome number.
* Input: 123456
Output: `false`
Explanation: `123456` is not a palindrome number.

### Constraints

* Input: A non-negative integer.
* Output: A boolean value.

### Solution Approach

We can solve this problem by iterating over the input string and comparing characters from the start and end of the string. If the characters match, we move to the next character in both directions. If we reach the end of the string without finding a match, we return `false`.

### Solution Code

```python
def isPalindrome(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    n_str = str(n)
    left = 0
    right = len(n_str) - 1
    while left < right:
        if n_str[left] != n_str[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Convert the input integer to a string using `str(n)`.
2. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the string, respectively.
3. Start a loop that continues until `left` is no longer less than `right`.
4. Inside the loop, compare the characters at the `left` and `right` indices. If they don't match, return `False`.
5. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, return `True`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n/2), where n is the input integer. In Big O notation, this can be simplified to O(n).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the input string.

### Alternative Solution using Python's built-in `==` Operator

We can also solve this problem by using Python's built-in `==` operator, which checks if two strings are equal.

```python
def isPalindrome(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    return str(n) == str(n)[::-1]
```

This solution is more concise and efficient, but it may not be as readable as the original solution.
