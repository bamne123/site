# Welcome

# Welcome to My LeetCode Blog  

Struggling with LeetCode? Youâ€™re not alone! As someone preparing for FAANG+ interviews, I understand how challenging it can be to translate DSA concepts into real solutions. This blog is my attempt to simplify the process by breaking down problems, sharing structured solutions, and providing step-by-step explanations.  

Whether youâ€™re a beginner or an experienced coder looking for optimized solutions, youâ€™ll find well-documented approaches, intuitive explanations, and alternative methods to enhance your problem-solving skills. Letâ€™s crack coding interviews together!
