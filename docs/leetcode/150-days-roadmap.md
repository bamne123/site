# 150-Day Roadmap

This document outlines a 150-day plan to prepare for MAANG interviews.

**Tips for using this roadmap:**

* Coding questions are from LeetCode and in order (Easy, Medium, Hard). 
* Choose days and questions based on your time and availability. 
* Every 6 days have coding questions. 
* Every 7th day, have one system design and one low-level design question. 
<!-- * System design and Low-level design questions are taken from these resources:
    * [System Design Resource](https://lnkd.in/dXywra2R) 
    * [Low-Level Design Resource 1](https://lnkd.in/d6yRpRvy) 
    * [Low-Level Design Resource 2](https://lnkd.in/deuAXR-U)  -->
* Every 15th day is a revision day for things practiced in the previous 14 days. 
* The last section, starting from the 120th day, also has behavioral interview questions. 
* If you miss any question on a particular day, just carry it over to the next day. 
* The idea is to be consistent for 150 days and not to solve all questions in a hurry.
