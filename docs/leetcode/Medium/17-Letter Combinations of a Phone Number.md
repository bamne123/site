**Letter Combinations of a Phone Number**

**Problem Statement**

Given a digits `n`, return all possible letter combinations that the digits could represent.

**Constraints**

* Each digit is represented by a letter with a unique combination (e.g., "b" for 1, "c" for 2, etc.).
* The total number of possible letter combinations for `n` digits is `6^n`.
* `n` can be any positive integer.

**Examples**

* Input: `n = 1` Output: `["a"]`
* Input: `n = 2` Output: `["ab", "ba"]`
* Input: `n = 3` Output: `["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"]`

**Code Solution**

```python
def letterCombinations(digits):
    """
    Returns all possible letter combinations that the digits could represent.
    """
    if not digits:
        return []

    # Define the mapping of digits to letters
    phone_mapping = {
        "2": "abc",
        "3": "def",
        "4": "ghi",
        "5": "jkl",
        "6": "mno",
        "7": "pqrs",
        "8": "tuv",
        "9": "wxyz"
    }

    # Base case: if there are no more digits to process, return the result
    if len(digits) == 0:
        return []

    # Initialize the result with an empty string
    result = []

    # Process each digit
    def backtrack(combination, remaining_digits):
        # If there are no more remaining digits, add the current combination to the result
        if len(remaining_digits) == 0:
            result.append(combination)
            return

        # Get the mapping for the current digit
        for letter in phone_mapping[remaining_digits[0]]:
            # Recursively call the backtrack function with the updated combination and remaining digits
            backtrack(combination + letter, remaining_digits[1:])

    # Start the backtracking process
    backtrack("", digits)

    # Return the result
    return result
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  Define the mapping of digits to letters as a dictionary.
2.  Initialize an empty result list to store the combinations.
3.  If there are no more digits to process, return the result.
4.  Initialize an empty combination and the remaining digits.
5.  Define a recursive backtrack function that takes the current combination and the remaining digits.
6.  If there are no more remaining digits, add the current combination to the result.
7.  Get the mapping for the current digit.
8.  Recursively call the backtrack function with the updated combination and remaining digits.
9.  Start the backtracking process by calling the backtrack function with an empty combination and the input digits.
10. Return the result.

**Example Usage**

```python
print(letterCombinations("23"))  # Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]
print(letterCombinations(""))  # Output: []
print(letterCombinations("1"))  # Output: ["a"]
print(letterCombinations("2"))  # Output: ["ab", "ba"]
```

**Time Complexity**

The time complexity of this solution is O(6^n), where n is the number of digits. This is because we need to process each digit and create all possible combinations of letters.

**Space Complexity**

The space complexity of this solution is O(6^n), where n is the number of digits. This is because we need to store all possible combinations of letters.
