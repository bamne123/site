## Container With Most Water

### Problem Statement

Given two containers with non-empty water reservoirs, find the maximum water that can be transferred from one container to the other. The water level in each container can change over time.

### Problem Details

*   **Input:** Two integers representing the minimum water capacity of each container (`input1` and `input2`)
*   **Link:** [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
*   **Companies:** [Known companies that frequently ask this problem]
*   **Tags:** [Two Pointers, Greedy]
*   **Difficulty:** Medium

### Example

*   Input: `input1 = 1`, `input2 = 2`
*   Output: `3`
*   Explanation: The given water can be transferred from the first container to the second container.

### Constraints

*   `1 <= input1, input2 <= 1000`
*   `0 <= input1 + input2 <= 2 * 10^4`
*   `0 <= input1 < input2`

### Solution Approach

*   **Two Pointers Algorithm**: We will use two pointers, one from each container, to simulate the flow of water.
*   **Fill the Container with Most Water**: We will keep track of the maximum water that can be transferred from the container with the larger water level.
*   **Move the Pointer with Less Water**: We will move the pointer with the smaller water level towards the other container.

### Complexity Analysis

*   Time Complexity: O(min(input1, input2))
*   Space Complexity: O(1)

### Code Implementation

```python
def maxWaterTransfer(input1, input2):
    max_flow = 0
    while True:
        # Initialize the water flow
        left, right = 0, 0
        # Initialize the water level
        water_left = min(input1, input2)
        water_right = max(input1, input2)
        while left <= water_left and right <= water_right:
            # Calculate the water flow
            flow = min(water_left, water_right) - left
            if flow > 0:
                max_flow += flow
                left += flow
            # Move the pointer with less water
            if water_left > water_right:
                left += 1
            else:
                right += 1
        # Check if the maximum flow is reached
        if left == water_left and right == water_right:
            break
    return max_flow
```

### Explanation

1.  We start by initializing the maximum flow to 0.
2.  We enter a loop that continues until no more flow can be added.
3.  In each iteration, we initialize the water flow to 0.
4.  We move the pointer with the smaller water level towards the other container.
5.  We calculate the maximum flow that can be transferred from the container with the larger water level.
6.  We add this flow to the maximum flow and move the pointer with less water.
7.  We repeat steps 4-6 until no more flow can be added.
8.  We return the maximum flow.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1.  Initialize `max_flow` to 0 and the water flow variables to 0.
2.  Move the pointer with the smaller water level towards the other container.
3.  Calculate the maximum flow that can be transferred from the container with the larger water level.
4.  Add the flow to `max_flow` and move the pointer with less water.
5.  Repeat steps 3-4 until no more flow can be added.
6.  Return `max_flow`.

### Alternative Approaches

1.  **Two-Pointer Technique**: We can use two pointers to simulate the flow of water, but this approach requires additional space.
2.  **Bridging**: We can use bridging to transfer water from one container to the other, but this approach also requires additional space.

### Common Mistakes and Pitfalls

1.  **Incorrect Initialization**: We initialize `max_flow` to 0 instead of the actual maximum flow.
2.  **Incorrect Calculation**: We calculate the maximum flow incorrectly.
