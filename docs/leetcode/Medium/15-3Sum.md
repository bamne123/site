**3Sum**

### Description

A problem where given an array of integers, find all unique triplets in the array that sum to zero.

#### Example

Input: `[−2, 0, 1, 2, −1, 2]`
Output: `\[ [-2, -1, 2], [-2, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 1] ]`

### Code Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * Finds all unique triplets in the given array that sum to zero.
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - The input array of integers.
 * @returns {number[][]} - A list of unique triplets that sum to zero.
 */
function threeSum(nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Sort the array to apply two-pointer technique
    const result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue; // Skip duplicates for the same element
        let left = i + 1, right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            const sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];

            if (sum < 0) {
                left++;
            } else if (sum > 0) {
                right--;
            } else {
                result.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]);

                // Skip duplicates for the same element on the left and right
                while (left < right && nums[left] === nums[left + 1]) left++;
                while (left < right && nums[right] === nums[right - 1]) right--;

                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n^3) - The worst-case time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n) - The space complexity, which is the maximum amount of extra space used by the algorithm.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Sort the array**: Sort the input array in ascending order. This is done to apply the two-pointer technique later.
2. **Find the first element**: Iterate over the sorted array and find the first element that will result in a sum of zero with another element. This element is the first element of the triplet.
3. **Find the second element**: Initialize two pointers, one at the next element of the first element and one at the end of the array. Move the left pointer to the right and the right pointer to the left, depending on the sum of the first two elements.
4. **Find the third element**: If the sum of the first two elements is less than zero, move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum. If the sum is equal to zero, add the triplet to the result list and move both pointers.
5. **Skip duplicates**: Skip duplicates for the same element on both the left and right sides to avoid duplicate triplets.

### Alternative Approach

1. **Two-pointer technique**: Use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array, to find the first element that will result in a sum of zero with another element.
2. **Brute force approach**: Iterate over the array and for each element, iterate over the rest of the array to find the remaining two elements that will result in a sum of zero.

### Additional Tips

* **Use a sorting algorithm**: Use a sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort to sort the array efficiently.
* **Avoid duplicates**: Skip duplicates for the same element on both the left and right sides to avoid duplicate triplets.
* **Use two-pointer technique**: Use the two-pointer technique to find the first element that will result in a sum of zero with another element.
