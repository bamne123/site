# Problem Title: [Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring)

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Tags:** String, Dynamic Programming

**Problem Statement:**  
Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

## Explanation  
A palindromic substring is a substring that reads the same backwards as forwards. For example, in the string "babad", the longest palindromic substring is "bab".

## Time & Space Complexity  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Solution  
```language
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        def expand_around_center(left: int, right: int) -> str:
            while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
                left -= 1
                right += 1
            return s[left + 1:right]
        
        longest = ""
        for i in range(len(s)):
            # odd length palindrome
            palindrome = expand_around_center(i, i)
            if len(palindrome) > len(longest):
                longest = palindrome
            
            # even length palindrome
            palindrome = expand_around_center(i, i + 1)
            if len(palindrome) > len(longest):
                longest = palindrome
        
        return longest
```

## Solution Explanation  
This solution uses a helper function `expand_around_center` to expand around the center of a palindrome and find the longest palindrome. It iterates over the string, treating each character as the center of a potential palindrome, and updates the `longest` substring if a longer palindrome is found.
